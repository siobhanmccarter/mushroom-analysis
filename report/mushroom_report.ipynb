    "This is a project for DSCI 573, a features and model selections class. The goal was to perform a full analysis on a dataset of my choosing. In this case, I chose a dataset pertaining to mushroom edibility. The goal was to create an accurate model that could predict whether or not a mushroom was edible given a set of attributes."
